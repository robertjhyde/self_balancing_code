# self_balancing_code
For use in 'Balancing Segway' project.

Each milestone represents steps to achieve the final result of balancing while dancing (Milstone 4b).
For example, Milestone 2 is for the robot to dance with stabilsers. Milestone 3 is code specifically for the robot to self balance with no added instructions.
