# self_balancing_code
For use in 'Balancing Segway' project.

Each milestone represents steps to achieve the final result of balancing while dancing (Milstone 4b).
For example, Milestone 3 is for the robot to dance with stabilsers. Milestone 4 is code specifically for testing the correct P, K and I values for the feedback control to enable the robot to self balance.
